summary: "A program I had done in ICS 111 which will create random pokemon data"
---

This is a program I had done in ICS 111 where you can choose one of the nine choices of pokemon and naming it whatever you 
want. Then it will generate a Pokemon with Species, the name user typed (if there is no name, the name will be the Pokemon 
species), the index number of this Pokemon and a random HP. After that, when click the list Pokemon, it will show all the 
Pokemon that just created in a listed order.
