## What is software engineering

Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of 
software application. In other word, software engineer not only coding the program, but also design and polish to make the 
whole program look nice and useful. Software engineer can be both fun and challenging with opportunities to work in almost any
industry including large and small businesses, government and so on.

## My interest on software engineering

This is my first time in touch of software engineering and javascript. I have learn some basic java, C++, and C programming 
language before. But Javascript is just a completely different things for me. However, I feel like javascript is easier than 
other programming language and I am excited to learn more about Javascript. I am hoping I can create some cool and useful 
software by using javascript.

## Expectation in the future

I hope I can master Javascript and get use to software engineering after ICS 314 class. Because Javascript is very fun for 
develop software to play with. Also, if I can master Javascript, there is a bigger chance that I can get a better job in my 
future career.
