##  First encounter

When I first in touch of Javascript, I already had learn about programming language such as Java, C, and C++. However, even 
though I already had experience with Java, Javascript is a completely different story than Java even they both have the name 
"Java". The biggest difference is that when I was working on JSFiddle which is using Javascript, I notice that rather than just 
typing code like Java does, there are HTML and CSS panel where we can write code on it as well! This is something that I didn't 
encounter in my Java or any other programming class.

## Reflection

After I had done the excerise from the homework assignment and the practice WOD in the class. I feel like Javascript is a good 
programming language from a software engineering because when we try to make software program, we not only want the program to 
work, we also want the software look as nice as possible. If the software is completely work but looking ugly, no one will like 
this software. If we using other programming language, there will be a lots of extra work since Java code, HTML code, and CSS 
code usually will be in the different file. However, Javascript can done all of those just by one.

## Thoughts

On the first practice WOD, I feel like Javascript is much enjoyable than other programming language which especially in my 
opionion, the C language. Programming on Javascript is less stressful and this will give me motivation to work better on the 
future WOD and homework, and I hope I can make good really good software project by the end of the sememster.
